/*
Write a SELECT statement that returns four columns: VendorName, Account-Description, LineItemCount, and LineItemSum.
 LineItemCount is the row count, and LineItemSum is the sum of the InvoiceLineItemAmount column. 
 For each vendor and account, return the number and sum of line items, sorted first by vendor, then by account description. Hint: Use a four-table join.
